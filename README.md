# MoodleQuoteBlock
 A custom addon for moodle that displays different quotes on the Moodle side tab as the user desires. Very much still a work in progress and only updated to fit Moodle 3.6.3. (released 3/11/19).
## Success Criteria 
- Program will be non-intrusive
- Program will be able to accept additional quotes into its database from the user
- Program will be able to be scheduled for when the quote changes (like every 24 hours, every 10 minutes, etc)
